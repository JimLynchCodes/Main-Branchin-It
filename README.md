# Main-Branchin-It

It's true! Github changed the name of the default branch from "master" to "main".

I think all propgrammers and technical people thought this whole argument was silly in the first place since branch names are often a "master / develop" relationship rather than "master / slave" or something that could be misconstrued as an offensive thing.

Anyway, just want to say that I support black lives matter and women and lgbtq community.
